        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          With over 5+ years of experience, I've been building up my skills in
          user experience, elegant design, and discipline that goes into
          front-end development.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I also learn and do experiments in full stack
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I develop designs to user interface using the most sophisticated
          technologies available today for fully interactive and responsive.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          I can work closely with designers and back-end developers, as a sole
          front-end or in Agile teams.
        </p>
