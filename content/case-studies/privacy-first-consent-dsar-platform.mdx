## Problem
Leading the frontend architecture for a privacy compliance platform designed to handle high-volume consent requests (GDPR/CCPA) and Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR). The legacy system was failing under load, and the manual DSAR process was costing legal teams 20+ hours a week.

<Callout variant="note" title="The Core Issue">
    Existing solutions treated privacy as an afterthought UI layer. We needed to bake compliance into the infrastructure itself.
</Callout>

## Constraints
*   **Scale:** System needed to process 10M+ consent signals/day with &lt;50ms latency.
*   **Compliance:** Strict legal requirements meant zero data loss tolerance.
*   **Legacy Data:** Had to migrate 5 years of user data without downtime.

## Approach
We rebuilt the consent widget using **Preact** for a 3kb bundle size, ensuring minimal impact on client site performance. The dashboard was migrated to **Next.js** with **Server Components**, reducing initial load time by 60%.

### Key Wins
1.  **Performance:** 50ms p99 latency for consent signal processing.
2.  **Reliability:** Achieved 99.99% uptime during peak traffic (Black Friday).
3.  **Efficiency:** Automated 80% of DSAR workflows.

```typescript
// Example of optimistic UI update for consent toggle
const toggleConsent = async (category: string) => {
  setPreferences(prev => ({ ...prev, [category]: !prev[category] }));
  await api.updateConsent(category); // Sync in background
};
```

## Tradeoffs
<Callout variant="warning" title="Consistency vs. Availability">
    We chose Eventual Consistency for consent statistics to prioritize Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP) for the user-facing widget. This meant admin dashboards were delayed by ~5 seconds, which was acceptable.
</Callout>

*   **Complexity:** The event sourcing architecture added initial development time but paid off in auditability.
*   **Storage:** Higher storage costs due to immutable audit logs.

## Impact
The new platform successfully handled the 10x traffic spike during the holiday season. Legal teams reported a **90% reduction** in manual DSAR processing time, allowing them to focus on high-value compliance strategy.

<Callout variant="success" title="Outcome">
    Reduced legal risk and saved ~$200k/year in operational costs.
</Callout>
