# Privacy-First Consent & DSAR Platform

## Overview
Leading the frontend architecture for a privacy compliance platform designed to handle high-volume consent requests (GDPR/CCPA) and Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR).

## The Challenge
*   **Scale:** System needed to process 10M+ consent signals/day with &lt;50ms latency.
*   **Compliance:** Strict legal requirements meant zero data loss tolerance.
*   **UX:** The admin dashboard for DSAR management was slow and confusing for legal teams.

## The Solution
We rebuilt the consent widget using **Preact** for a 3kb bundle size, ensuring minimal impact on client site performance. The dashboard was migrated to **Next.js** with **Server Components**, reducing initial load time by 60%.

### Key Wins
1.  **Performance:** 50ms p99 latency for consent signal processing.
2.  **Reliability:** Achieved 99.99% uptime during peak traffic (Black Friday).
3.  **Efficiency:** Automated 80% of DSAR workflows, saving legal teams ~20 hours/week.

## Technical Deep Dive
```typescript
// Example of optimistic UI update for consent toggle
const toggleConsent = async (category: string) => {
  setPreferences(prev => ({ ...prev, [category]: !prev[category] }));
  await api.updateConsent(category); // Sync in background
};
```
