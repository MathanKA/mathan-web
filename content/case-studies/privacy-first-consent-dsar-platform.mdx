## What I built

A developer-first privacy layer that turns **consent + DSAR** into **code-level primitives** (not just a banner), and generates **tamper-evident evidence** you can actually show during security/legal reviews.

## The problem (in plain English)

Most privacy tooling stops at UI. Real compliance lives deeper:
- which routes run,
- which jobs fire,
- which scripts execute,
- how exports/deletes happen,
- and whether you can **prove** the above later.

## The approach

### 1) Consent that gates real behavior
- Consent banner + preference center
- Purpose model (typed keys) so “illegal states are harder to represent”
- Server-side guards for routes/jobs (privacy-as-code)

### 2) DSAR exports that don’t melt servers
- Queue → worker → streaming export → S3 object
- Signed download links with expiry
- Audit events across lifecycle: requested → verified → processing → ready → downloaded/expired

### 3) Evidence by default (tamper-evident audit)
- Hash-chained audit events for consent/DSAR/retention actions
- Designed for exporting regulator/customer-friendly timelines (“evidence bundles”)

## Architecture snapshot

- Next.js App Router app serves:
  - public consent UI
  - DSAR portal
  - admin surfaces
- Worker consumes BullMQ queues for heavy jobs
- Postgres stores domain-tenant mapping, consent state, DSAR state, audit events
- S3 stores export archives

## What I’d improve next

- External audit anchors (stronger tamper resistance)
- More admin evidence surfaces (filters, exportable reports)
- DPDP/GDPR “packs” to make jurisdiction toggles dead simple
```
