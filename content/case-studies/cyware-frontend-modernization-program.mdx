## TL;DR

<Callout variant="note" title="Engineering Focus">
  This was a program of parallel workstreams: keep shipping under security and
  demo pressure while modernizing performance, accessibility, and build
  ergonomics without breaking delivery cadence.
</Callout>

## What I Owned

- Frontend delivery leadership across product and marketing surfaces
- Incremental migration and refactor planning to reduce risk
- Performance optimization for Core Web Vitals and bundle strategy
- Accessibility remediation with QA and VPAT partners
- Team coaching to keep releases predictable under executive visibility

## Problem

Cyware needed to accelerate delivery across customer platforms and the marketing
site while reducing risk in performance, accessibility, and security-sensitive
flows. The goal was not a rewrite; it was to keep demo and release cadence
moving while lifting quality and maintainability.

## Constraints

- Security-first expectations: UI defects could translate into trust issues.
- Frequent CTO demos with tight timelines demanded predictable delivery.
- Mixed legacy stacks (Angular 2+, Vue 2) limited appetite for disruptive
  rewrites.
- Accessibility obligations: WCAG 2.1 AA remediation with VPAT-aligned reporting
  and external stakeholders.
- Performance expectations on public pages: measurable Lighthouse gains on key
  pages with stable layout behavior.
- NDA boundaries: share practices, not customer-specific implementation detail.

## Approach

Treated the work as a modernization program broken into contained streams, each
with a clear definition of done, measurement, and rollback paths.

### Workstream 1 - Threat Intelligence Platform delivery (Angular 2+ -> Vue 2) with CTO demos and CERT-In shipment

**Goal:** Deliver a feature-rich Threat Intelligence Platform with demo
readiness and production stability.

What I did:

- Delivered early modules in Angular 2+, then supported and executed a Vue 2
  revamp to improve maintainability and UI agility.
- Partnered directly with the CTO for demo-critical workflows:
  - scoped demo-ready increments without destabilizing core flows,
  - prioritized clarity in data rendering and error states,
  - enforced incremental change windows with review checkpoints.
- Supported the initial production release for CERT-In with a reliability focus.
- Earned an annual increment (~20%) tied to delivery outcomes.

### Workstream 2 - cyware.com Nuxt revamp; Lighthouse ~60 -> ~90 (sole lead for 2+ years)

**Goal:** Make the marketing site fast, stable, and maintainable while handling
content growth.

What I owned end to end:

- Sole lead developer for cyware.com implementation and long-term maintenance
  for 2+ years.
- Nuxt-based revamp centered on measurable improvements:
  - Critical Rendering Path tuning to reduce render blocking,
  - asset compression and long-term caching,
  - layout stability fixes (CLS) via predictable image sizing and container
    heights,
  - responsive and cross-device consistency.
- Result: Lighthouse performance increased from ~60 -> ~90 on key pages (mobile
  Lighthouse runs in Chrome DevTools for homepage and blog pages) during the
  optimization cycles.

### Workstream 3 - Situational Awareness Platform accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA and VPAT support (~1-2 months to certification)

**Goal:** Contribute to WCAG 2.1 AA remediation and help reach VPAT-based
certification.

How I approached it:

- Partnered with QA and external VPAT stakeholders to triage issues by severity
  and user impact.
- Fixed keyboard navigation, focus management, semantic structure, and ARIA
  usage where needed; addressed heading order, labels, contrast, and interactive
  control semantics.
- Set a remediation loop: reproduce -> fix -> validate with keyboard and screen
  reader expectations -> regression check.
- Mentored junior engineers on accessibility-first implementation patterns.
- Outcome: helped the product achieve VPAT-based accessibility certification
  within ~1-2 months of joining that workstream.

### Workstream 4 - Orchestrate refactor: Vue 3 + Vite; bundle ~10MB -> ~4MB

**Goal:** Reduce performance and maintainability risk by modernizing build and
runtime patterns.

Key decisions:

- Refactored legacy areas with Vue 3 and Vite to improve developer experience
  and build performance.
- Implemented dynamic imports for heavy modules, route-level code splitting,
  and vendor chunk extraction to stabilize caching.
- Result: reduced initial JavaScript bundle size from ~10MB -> ~4MB based on
  Vite bundle analyzer comparisons for the initial bundle shipped to clients.

### Workstream 5 - Cyware Social alpha: social graph with security-aware controls

**Goal:** Build a social-style collaboration surface with security-conscious UX
and access controls.

What I delivered:

- Led frontend for an alpha experience with posts, likes, comments, follows,
  feeds, and profiles (social graph navigation).
- Implemented role- and permission-aware UI states, guarded actions, and input
  handling patterns to reduce injection and misuse risk in rendered content.
- Outcome: reached alpha testing; paused later due to legal constraints.

## Tradeoffs

- Incremental modernization instead of a full rewrite reduced risk but required
  strict boundaries between old and new patterns.
- Reused Bootstrap and existing UI primitives to ship faster; a full redesign
  would have slowed critical releases.
- Balanced performance work with feature velocity by using measurement (mobile
  Lighthouse runs, bundle analysis) to target changes instead of blanket
  optimization.
- Accessibility under deadlines relied on triage and phased cleanup rather than
  attempting full remediation at once.

## Impact

### Metrics (measured or time-bound)

| Metric | Value | Type | Measurement context |
|---|---:|---|---|
| cyware.com Lighthouse performance | ~60 -> ~90 | Measured (approx) | Mobile Lighthouse runs in Chrome DevTools on homepage and blog pages during optimization cycles |
| Orchestrate initial JS bundle size | ~10MB -> ~4MB | Measured (approx) | Vite bundle analyzer comparison for initial JavaScript shipped to clients |
| Accessibility certification | Achieved within ~1-2 months of joining effort | Measured (approx timeframe) | WCAG 2.1 AA remediation with QA and external VPAT stakeholders |
| Delivery recognition | Annual increment ~20% | Measured (approx) | Recognition tied to delivery outcomes including CERT-In release and demo readiness |

### Outcomes delivered

- Faster, more stable marketing surface with measurable Lighthouse gains
- Reduced risk and improved maintainability through targeted modernization
- Accessibility improvements aligned to WCAG 2.1 AA and VPAT expectations
- Security-aware social alpha delivered to testing before being paused for
  legal reasons
- Shipped high-stakes releases under executive demo pressure without sacrificing
  quality

## Evidence & Measurement Notes

- Lighthouse: used as a repeatable guide for Critical Rendering Path and CLS
  improvements on marketing pages.
- Bundle size: validated with Vite bundle analyzer outputs while refactoring the
  initial JavaScript bundle.
- Accessibility: triage, remediation, and validation loop with QA and external
  VPAT-focused stakeholders.
- Redaction policy: architectural and practice-level details only; customer
  data, internal URLs, and proprietary workflows are excluded.

## Redactions (NDA-safe)

- Customer names, internal URLs, and proprietary workflow details are omitted.
- Screenshots and traces are excluded unless explicitly cleared for sharing.
